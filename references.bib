@article{McManus2012,
abstract = {Visual Teach and Repeat (VT{\&}R) has proven to be an effective method to allow a vehicle to autonomously repeat any previously driven route without the need for a global positioning system. One of the major challenges for a method that relies on visual input to recognize previously visited places is lighting change, as this can make the appearance of a scene look drastically different. For this reason, passive sensors, such as cameras, are not ideal for outdoor environments with inconsistent/inadequate light. However, camera-based systems have been very successful for localization and mapping in outdoor, unstructured terrain, which can be largely attributed to the use of sparse, appearance-based computer vision techniques. Thus, in an effort to achieve lighting invariance and to continue to exploit the heritage of the appearance-based vision techniques traditionally used with cameras, this paper presents the first VT{\&}R system that uses appearance-based techniques with laser scanners for motion estimation. The system has been field tested in a planetary analogue environment for an entire diurnal cycle, covering more than 11km with an autonomy rate of 99.7{\%} of the distance traveled.},

@article{Saarinen2013,
abstract = {In order to enable long-term operation of autonomous vehicles in industrial environments numerous challenges need to be addressed. A basic requirement for many applications is the creation and maintenance of consistent 3D world models. This article proposes a novel 3D spatial representation for online real-world mapping, building upon two known representations: normal distributions transform (NDT) maps and occupancy grid maps. The proposed normal distributions transform occupancy map (NDT-OM) combines the advantages of both representations; compactness of NDT maps and robustness of occupancy maps. One key contribution in this article is that we formulate an exact recursive updates for NDT-OMs. We show that the recursive update equations provide natural support for multi-resolution maps. Next, we describe a modification of the recursive update equations that allows adaptation in dynamic environments. As a second key contribution we introduce NDT-OMs and formulate the occupancy update equations that allow to build consistent maps in dynamic environments. The update of the occupancy values are based on an efficient probabilistic sensor model that is specially formulated for NDT-OMs. In several experiments with a total of 17 hours of data from a milk factory we demonstrate that NDT-OMs enable real-time performance in large-scale, long-term industrial setups.},

@inproceedings{Mazuran2015,
abstract = {Mobile robot localization is a mature field that over the years has demonstrated its effectiveness and robust-ness. The majority of the approaches, however, rely on a globally consistent map, and localize on it in an absolute coordinate frame. This global consistency cannot be guaranteed when the map is estimated by the robot itself, and an error in the map will likely result in the failure of the localization subsystem. In this paper we introduce a novel paradigm for localization, namely relative topometric localization, by which we forgo the need for a globally consistent map. We adopt a graph-based representation of the environment, and estimate both the topological location on the graph and the relative metrical position with respect to it. We extensively evaluated our approach and tested it against Monte Carlo localization on both simulated and real data. The results show significant improvements in scenarios where there is no globally consistent map.},

We show constraint-sensitive means of perturbing transformation matrices using their associated exponential-map generators and demonstrate these tools on three simple-yet-important estimation problems: 1) propagating uncertainty through a compound pose change, 2) fusing multiple measurements of a pose (e.g., for use in pose-graph relaxation), and 3) propagating uncertainty on poses (and landmarks) through a nonlinear camera model. The contribution of the paper is the presentation of the theoretical tools, which can be applied in the analysis of many problems involving 3-D pose and point variables.},

@inproceedings{Bosse2013,
abstract = {In developing autonomous solutions for mapping and localization, one problem that often needs to be dealt with is determining when an area is revisited despite having poor or no prior information on the relative alignment error. There are well-formulated approaches for recognizing such matches using the rich information in camera data; however, it is a much more challenging problem using lidar sensors alone. Most existing approaches employ a pairwise place comparison of place descriptors and thus finding matches requires linear time per place. We instead propose the use of a keypoint voting approach to achieve sub-linear matching times. A constant number of nearest neighbor votes per keypoint are queried from a database of local descriptors and aggregated to determine likely place matches. It becomes critical to analyze the distributions of vote scores such that a suitable threshold for matching scores can be determined a priori, so that the system is not overwhelmed by false positives nor starved for true matches. We have empirically determined that the vote scores follow a log-normal distribution, and we are able to fit a parametric model of its hyper-parameters based on the number of neighbors, the number of keypoints in a place, and the total number of keypoints in the database. We demonstrate the performance of our system in a variety of large scale 3D lidar datasets using data collected from a continually scanning handheld lidar sensor, and also on two publicly available lidar datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The covariance of every unbiased estimator is bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix. This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders, Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty. This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the ICP (iterative closest/corresponding point) algorithm. Finally, it is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.},
